OCaml implementation of Luby transform code

## Technical details

PRNG and hash used are based on xorshift to achieve good performance

Degree selection of drops is randomly generated once during construction of encoder,
and randomly regenerated once during resetting. This is to ensure a bad selection
does not have a lasting effect.

The robust soliton distribution is used for the degree selection, with constant
factors tuned to favour low degree count.
There is an additional modification for the case of systematic encoding,
in which degrees of parity drops are multiplied
by a factor proportional to the ratio between data blocks and parity drops.
This essentially "amplifies" the coverage of each parity drop due to
the reduced total number of parity drops.
